# The creative environment CLI

This command-line interface was created so that the installation of the creative environment Creenv is easier for you.

## 1. Installation

If you're on *windows*, I recommend that you start using [cmder](http://cmder.net/): a functional / good-looking console emulator, making your console experience finaly decent. You will need node and npm to be able to work with this project. Fortunatly, npm comes with [node](https://nodejs.org/) which is easy to install, so go for it. If you have no idea on what node and npm are, i strongly recommend that you read a paper to have an idea on what those tools do.

Open your terminal. We will first install **create-creenv** globaly.

```bash
npm install -g create-creenv
```

(*if you're on windows you may want to restart your console at this point*). Navigate to the folder you want to create your project in.

```bash 
cd /path/to/my/folder
```

Run the create-creenv command. This will create a folder, named by the argument you give to create-creenv, which will contain your project. 

```bash 
create-creenv my-super-project
```

**And you're done. From now, I recommend that you check the [boilerplate page](https://github.com/bcrespy/creenv-boilerplate) to understand how to use this starter project :)**
